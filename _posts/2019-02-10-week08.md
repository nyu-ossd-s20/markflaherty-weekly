This week we set out our roadmap for moving forward with our project. We have reached out to the top contributers (owners) of the project. Thus our roadmap is complete with how we can contribute moving forward. It looks like we are going to start small with some docmentation. I plan on making my first contribution for the group later this week. 

On the other hand, I do not enjoy the transition to online classes. As a graduating senior it is really sad that I do not get a commencement. I was hoping to enjoy my last few months of college but it looks like I will just be spending it in quarantine.
