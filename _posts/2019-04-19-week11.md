title: Week 11
---

This week brought alot of troubles, but some more successes. I was forced to relocate again because of covid-19, but on the brighter side this allowed me to reflect what my open source contributions should be looking like. Since then I have added some documentation, and I am about to finish a small bug fix which I found while reading through the code. I as I am writing this however, I remember that I did not tell my team about this on slack, so that is my first order of business to accomplish. For this coming week I hope to find something that challenges me more than what ive been doing so far.
