title: Week 4

This week we had some excellent speakers this week. I especially liked hearing about what Deena had to say about data management and cleaning. This is a field that I am very much interesting in pursuing outside of college, so it was cool to ask questions about how she approaches her work. One thing I particularly liked was the discussion about collaborating with people from multiple different fields. Deena brought up an annecdote about how she is currently working with an anthropologist. I found this to be very interesting because it goes to show how software development is applicable to every career path. Likewise, I liked learning about the specific protocols taken to clean a data set, and how they vary from dataset to dataset. In my free time I do alot of analysis of NBA datasets using BeautifulSoup4 and requests, thus I liked hearing about a more professional approach to web scraping and data management. There was honestly nothing that I disliked about the speakers, I found them to be very informational and interesting.
