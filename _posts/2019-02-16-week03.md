My personal contributions to the extension project ended up being mostly touching up CSS and then documentation. We worked well together and even met up outside of class to finish the project. Likewise, since our extension was quiet simple, I mostly learned alot about how to work with people on a common goal. For our group, Anastasia was the JavaScript master so she took the wheel when it came to the functionality of the extension, so I had to find another way to be useful in the group. Thus I found myself to be learning about how to ask proper questions and how to be helpful without not necessarily writing code. Another thing I learned was how to brainstorm well so that each group member was able to see the roadmap that we were taking. 

Throughout this project, I realized that I was not as competent in JavaScript as I thought. I learned alot about general web development and seeing how developers put their work into a web application. One thing that I liked learning about was how well rounded the developer tools FireFox has are. Moreover, I found it to be very informative and interesting seeing how web applications and extensions are made.
