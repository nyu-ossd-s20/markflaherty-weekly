My group and I are making a top sites background changer. The extension will choose the background for your most frequently visited sites. As of right now, we have our repository made and our design laid out. We will hopefully accomplish the code written as of Monday, Feb. 10th. Thus we are still delegating tasks to each member, however, we are familiar with eachothers current competencies in creating a browser extension. Some of the things I have learned so far are: manifest JSON files, and the inner workings of an extension itself. I am very excited to put my JavaScript skills to the test in the coming days before our presentation.
