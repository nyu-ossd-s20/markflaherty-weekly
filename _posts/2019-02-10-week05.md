I was really surprised about how inviting open source development was. When looking at InkScape I thought it was definetly just going to be a code base, and not have any sort of way of navigating their site. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they encourage help from others, not just allow it. It was challenging to dive right into their code base because it was hard to know where to start. When we code for school or a job it is much more linear than a library. That being said, after reading a little bit more you could get more of a sense for the things being done there. I do have a couple ideas of projects that I want to work on. One I found was called Keras, and it was a python ML library that needed help documenting. 

Unfortunately, I was ill when the speaker came to class. However, I have heard many good things about develment work at Bloomberg and wish I could have attended to ask some good questions.
