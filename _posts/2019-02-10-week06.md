title: Week 6

I really enjoyec what Vicky had to say about about openData and her job. Likewise, it made me look into the NYC OpenData week. I found that she had alot of cool things to say about her job. Moreover, I thought it was interesting as we talked about some of the legal side affects of open source and the current litigation between Google and Oracle. All around, I was happy to hear her speak to our class again. 

I think I would like to eventually work with Keras, but I would also like to see some more projects. I recently looked into Rebound that is a command line tool that immediately fetches results from stackoverflow when you have an error. I think thats something that I could actually contribute meaningful code to. I have found the process of reviewing these projects to be very insightful to my own skillset as well.
