When I hear the about Open Source, I automatically think about collaboration. I think about how it is the best way to combine different minds that create something greater than what one person can accomplish. The major advantages of open source software is that it is open to people to freely read, use, or build off of. That being said, some of the risks are that its users are unaware of the specific liscening and that it may not be properly maintained overtime. Moreover, the technical debt can grow rapidly. However, I signed up for this class because I felt as if alot of my other classes were very theoretical, and I thought that the best way to read alot of code and learn about how software developers are progressing is through learning about open source. 



Four open source projects that I frequent are wikipedia, python, elasticsearch, and selenium. I have been using wikipedia for almost as long as I can remember, and I have recently been more inclined to work with python as I used elasticsearch with pyhton in my previous internship. Likewise, I like to use Selenium for web crawling, especially if I am watching amazon prices.
